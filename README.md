Project Description
[Sarcastic Kerala-rooted poster generator built with Next.js App Router. It behaves like an old Kerala uncle who ignores your request and creates the complete opposite style â€” but with modern, cinematic taste and subtle cultural nods.]

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Weâ€™re solving the problem of posters being too accurate and too pretty.
Aesthetic Kunjappan ensures your request is flipped, roasted, and designed like a 90s uncleâ€™s chaotic masterpiece.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By taking your idea, flipping it on its head with AI, sprinkling in sarcastic uncle-level roasts, and generating a gloriously wrong poster.
Itâ€™s designâ€¦ but with maximum disrespect and minimum relevance.k]
